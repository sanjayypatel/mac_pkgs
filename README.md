# mac_pkgs

### Description
Automated macOS software packaging for patch management systems.

This project repurposes major pieces of the [Installomator](https://github.com/Installomator/Installomator) project for the major mechanical bits that download and verify software installers.

Where mac_pkgs diverges, is that it is intended to be run on a macOS server on a schedule to maintain a repository of patches in pkg files ready for upload to patch management systems, such has a Jamf distribution point.
